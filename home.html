    <h1>Testimonials from our members</h1>
    <p>All of our current and past members ar every satisfied with the experience that they get 
        from us. Most of our beginner coders have yet developed into pros, and some of our pros
         have made it into big companies. If we ask around the club, telling the members to be
          completely honest and not biased about our services, the answers we get the most is that 
          'we are student friendly, we do not let imposter sysndrome prevent our members from participating 
          in events, we use the each on teach one method which is very helpful come to think about it when
           it comes to some of the shy students and our introverted ones.</p>
